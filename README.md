# Mapping Earthquakes 
Exploring Earthquakes across the World.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
We have been tasked to complete this project, using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website](https://www.usgs.gov/) and retrieving geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Approach
Our approach will be to use the JavaScript and the JSON Data-Driven Documents (D3) library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We will use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
